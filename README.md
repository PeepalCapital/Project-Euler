# Project-Euler

Link: https://projecteuler.net/

Just my solutions to some of the project Euler problems. I believe members of the website are not allowed to share solutions publicly beyond #100. 

Please note some of my solutions are not elegant as I have very limited knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Moreover I am a newbie in programming.

My prefferred language is Python followed by C. 

I genuinely try to solve the question by hand using math concepts rather than trying brute force intitially. For instance see my solution to #69.
